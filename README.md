# Ch-ust

Welcome to Ch-ust. Ch-ust is an implementation of chess in the Rust language. I wrote it as a way to experiement with Rust as a language. If you want to use it, just install the latest version of rust, pull down this repository, and run the project using "cargo run". This tool is interacted with solely through the command line.

Ch-ust allows you to do the following.

1. Play chess.
3. Pull a chess board from a FEN file.
4. Save a game to a FEN file.

My work on Ch-ust is now finished. I won't be making any more commits to this project. If you find an issue with it, feel free to put in a bug report, or create a pull request for the issue. If you want to clone this repository for your own purposes of changing or extending it, feel free to do so!
